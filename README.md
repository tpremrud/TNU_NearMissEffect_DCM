# TNU_NearMissEffect_DCM
 Class Project in Translational Neuromodeling (TN) course, ETH Zurich
 
 As I have learned about the dynamic causal modeling in TN, this is a project demonstrating the effect of near-miss effect, which is the alignment of two consecutive same symbols on the electronic gambling machine or slot machine, and the last symbol being different than the first two. This effect then reinforces or urges the player to play more.
 
The high-level review of the project can be seen [here](tpremrud.github.io/projects/gambling_proj/).
